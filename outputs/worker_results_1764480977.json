    "result": "The input \"sdfsdfsdf\" appears to be a random string or placeholder text rather than a clear topic or question. Among the search results, the closest related context is in the second result mentioning a URL with a query parameter \"code=sdfsdfsdf\" that doesn't work as expected in a browser but works with adb for app links.\n\nTherefore, it seems you might be asking about or referencing a problem related to URL parameters, app link handling, or possibly testing with dummy codes like \"sdfsdfsdf.\" If you want to clarify or troubleshoot how URLs with certain query parameters work in browsers vs. apps, or if you need help with dummy data usage or understanding what \"sdfsdfsdf\" might represent, please provide more details.\n\nIn summary, \"sdfsdfsdf\" itself does not correspond to a specific known topic; it is likely a placeholder or test string, possibly related to app link URL testing."
