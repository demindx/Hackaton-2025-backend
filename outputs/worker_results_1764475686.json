This will help determine the correct interpretation and assist you better."

    "prompt": "Analyze the number 132 for mathematical properties such as factors, prime status, or significance.",
    "result": "The number 132 has several interesting mathematical properties:\n\n1. Composite Number:  \n132 is not prime because it has factors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. Factors:  \nThe factors of 132 are:  \n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 33, 44, 66, and 132.  \nThese include both small and larger divisors, indicating 132 is a highly composite number.\n\n3. Prime Factorization:  \nBreaking down 132 into its prime factors:  \n132 ÷ 2 = 66  \n66 ÷ 2 = 33  \n33 ÷ 3 = 11  \n11 is prime.  \nSo, prime factorization is:  \n**132 = 2² × 3 × 11**\n\n4. Special Number Types:  \n- Oblong Number (or pronic number): 132 is the product of two consecutive integers, 11 and 12 (132 = 11 × 12). Oblong numbers represent the number of dots in a rectangular arrangement with one side longer by one unit than the other.  \n- Connection to Primes: The sum of the two integers 11 and 12 is 23, which is the 9th prime number.\n\n5. Position in Number Sequences:  \n132 is the 99th number in some sequences (e.g., the 99th natural number), but specifically, its significance as an oblong number stands out.\n\nIn summary, 132 is a composite, even, oblong number with prime factorization 2² × 3 × 11, and it has a rich set of factors. Its factor pairs, prime factors, and relation to consecutive integers make it mathematically interesting."

    "prompt": "Retrieve general information or common references related to the number 132 in various fields like history, science, or culture.",
    "result": "The number 132 has several notable attributes and references across different fields:\n\n1. Mathematics:\n- 132 is an even composite number.\n- It is the product of three distinct prime numbers.\n- It has twelve divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 22, 33, 44, 66, and 132.\n- It sits naturally between 131 and 133.\n\n2. Library Science:\n- In the Dewey Decimal Classification system, numbers like 132 may be part of call numbers used to organize books by subject. While 132 itself is not a primary Dewey class, understanding its place helps in grasping library organization and classification.\n\n3. Culture and Other Fields:\n- No specific historical or cultural references to the number 132 appeared in the search results.\n- The number does not seem to be directly linked to legal citation formats or occupational classification beyond general mentions.\n\nSummary:\n132 is primarily recognized as a mathematically interesting integer due to its divisors and prime factorization. It also appears in organizational systems like library classification but does not have widely known significance in history or culture based on the available information."
