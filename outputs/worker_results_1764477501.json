    "result": "Fortnite is a popular online multiplayer game known for its unique blend of shooting, building, and exploration mechanics. The basic gameplay revolves around players competing against each other in various game modes, with the most prominent being Battle Royale and Creative.\n\n**Battle Royale**  \n- This is Fortnite's flagship mode where 100 players drop onto an island and compete to be the last player or team standing.  \n- Players start with no equipment and must scavenge for weapons, resources, and items scattered across the map.  \n- A key mechanic that differentiates Fortnite from other battle royale games is its building system. Players can gather materials like wood, brick, and metal to construct walls, ramps, and other structures to defend themselves, gain high ground, or traverse the terrain strategically.  \n- The playable area gradually shrinks due to an encroaching storm, forcing players into closer encounters and increasing the intensity of matches.  \n- Matches can be played solo, duo, or in squads.\n\n**Creative Mode**  \n- Creative mode offers a sandbox environment where players can build their own islands and design custom game experiences.  \n- Players have access to all the game’s assets and building tools without combat pressure, allowing for experimentation and creativity.  \n- It supports a range of custom game types, mini-games, and cooperative builds that can be shared with others.\n\nIn addition to these, Fortnite features multiple other game modes and limited-time events, but Battle Royale and Creative remain the core experiences, combining fast-paced combat with innovative building mechanics and broad creative freedom."

    "prompt": "Describe the controls and user interface for playing Fortnite on different platforms (PC, console, mobile).",
    "result": "Fortnite's controls and user interface (UI) vary across platforms—PC, consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch), and mobile—to optimize gameplay for each device's input methods.\n\n**PC:**\n- **Controls:** Primarily keyboard and mouse. Movement uses WASD keys; aiming and looking are controlled by the mouse, allowing precise aiming. Jump, crouch, and other actions are mapped to keyboard keys (e.g., spacebar for jump, Ctrl for crouch). Inventory management and building use keyboard shortcuts and mouse buttons.\n- **UI:** The PC interface displays keybind hints corresponding to keyboard and mouse inputs. The HUD shows health, shield, map, ammo, and building materials with clear visuals suited for a larger screen.\n\n**Console (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch):**\n- **Controls:** Uses gamepads with analog sticks for movement and camera control. Buttons are mapped for jumping, crouching, shooting, building, and switching weapons. For example, the left joystick moves the character, the right joystick controls the camera, and face buttons handle actions like jump and interact.\n- **UI:** The UI shows button prompts corresponding to the console controller buttons (e.g., \"X\" or \"A\" for jump). The interface is optimized for TV screens, with larger icons and menus navigable via the controller.\n\n**Mobile (iOS, Android):**\n- **Controls:** Touchscreen controls with on-screen virtual joysticks and buttons. Movement is typically on the bottom left joystick, and actions like jump and crouch are buttons on the right or top right of the screen. Picking up items is often automatic by running over them, and interacting/opening items is done via tapping.\n- **UI:** The UI is simplified and designed for touch input, with larger buttons and minimal clutter to fit smaller screens. Key functions like building or switching weapons have dedicated on-screen buttons or gestures.\n\nIn summary, Fortnite adapts its controls and UI to each platform's input capabilities: keyboard/mouse for PC, controllers for consoles, and touch interfaces for mobile, ensuring the gameplay experience feels natural and accessible regardless of device."

    "prompt": "Provide tips on basic strategies and building techniques essential for success in Fortnite.",
    "result": "Here are some essential tips on basic strategies and building techniques for success in Fortnite, gathered from expert guides and pro advice:\n\n1. **Master the Basics of Building**  \n   - Start by learning how to quickly build fundamental structures such as walls, ramps, floors, and roofs. These provide immediate cover and high ground advantage in fights.  \n   - Practice building simple 1x1 towers to gain height and better positioning.  \n   - Use ramps to gain elevation while moving, allowing you to peek and shoot safely.\n\n2. **Use Building for Defense and Offense**  \n   - When under fire, quickly build walls around you to block incoming damage.  \n   - Combine walls with ramps and floors to create a fortified structure that protects you from multiple angles.  \n   - Use building aggressively to gain the high ground over opponents—height advantage significantly improves your chances of winning engagements.\n\n3. **Edit Structures for Flexibility**  \n   - Learn to edit your built structures (e.g., creating windows or doors in walls) to shoot through or quickly escape.  \n   - Editing allows for surprise attacks and repositioning without fully exposing yourself.\n\n4. **Gather Materials Efficiently**  \n   - Always collect wood, brick, and metal while moving through the map—materials are critical for building in fights.  \n   - Wood builds fastest but is weakest; metal is strongest but slower to build. Use materials strategically depending on the situation.\n\n5. **Incorporate Mental Resilience and Adaptation**  \n   - Stay calm during fights and adapt your building strategy based on opponents’ moves.  \n   - Learn to read the meta and adjust your tactics accordingly.\n\n6. **Practice Building Under Pressure**  \n   - Use creative mode or training maps to practice fast building and editing without pressure.  \n   - Build muscle memory for quick, instinctive construction during battle.\n\nBy focusing on these foundational building skills and strategic approaches, you will greatly improve your chances of success in Fortnite matches."
