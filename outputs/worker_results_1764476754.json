    "prompt": "Generate a friendly and culturally appropriate response in Russian to the user's greeting 'как дела', meaning 'how are you?'.",
    "result": "A friendly and culturally appropriate response in Russian to the greeting «Как дела?» could be:\n\n- «Спасибо, хорошо! А у тебя?»  \n(Thank you, good! And you?)\n\nThis is a common, polite, and warm reply that invites the other person to share how they are doing as well. For a female speaker, if you want to be especially polite or thankful, you could say:\n\n- «Спасибо, что спросила! У меня всё хорошо. А у тебя?»  \n(Thank you for asking! I’m doing well. And you?)\n\nFor a more casual or informal reply among friends, you might say:\n\n- «Нормально, спасибо. А у тебя?»  \n(Okay/fine, thanks. And you?)\n\nAll these responses fit well within Russian conversational norms and show friendliness and interest in the other person’s well-being."
